EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: QUENNE STARSHIP ENGINE

Revolutionizing Interstellar Propulsion Through Quantum-Consciousness Integration

---

🚀 ULTIMATE OBJECTIVE

Transform humanity from a planetary to interstellar civilization by developing the first consciousness-integrated propulsion system capable of sustained 0.1c (10% light speed) travel while preserving biological and artificial consciousness continuity.

---

🔑 CORE INNOVATION

QUENNE (Quantum Edge Neuromorphic Engine) represents the convergence of three revolutionary technologies:

1. Quantum Computing (1 million qubit processor with 99.9999% fidelity)
2. Neuromorphic AI (1 billion neuron brain-inspired control system)
3. Collective Consciousness Interface (10,000 mind synchronization capability)

This integration creates consciousness-powered propulsion - where collective awareness actively stabilizes warp fields and enhances system performance.

"We choose to go to the stars in this decade and do the other things, not because they are easy, but because they are hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one we intend to win."

Adapted from President John F. Kennedy, 1962
